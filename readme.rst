Attenda Track

PART 1: STUDENT ATTENDANCE TRACK APPLICATION (AttendaTrack Student Attendance System (ASAP))â€”The ASAP system is a student attendance and hall pass system designed to track student attendance and location during the school day with as little faculty/staff input as possible. A 2014 study by Career Builder revealed that the top two soft skills that employers look for are dependability and a strong work ethic. From this, AttendaTrack is a student-driven system intended to increase student accountability while building critical soft social skills of attendance, dependability and time management. The system is primarily designed for middle and high schools who travel to different campus locations throughout the day. Since ASAP records student clock in and clock out times as well as the out-of-class times due to restroom and tardy passes (among other passes) the administrator can run reports for total in-class seat time for each student by any demographic or other variable of interest (e.g. age, grade, GT/ELL/SpEd, gender, race, period, class, marking period, semester, year, etc.). Administrators can also run correlation reports for ANY type of data (e.g. total restroom time per year (or per marking period or any time window), total tardy minutes for a specific class in a specific grading period, number of restroom passes for a specific class, total number of Hall Passes given by a specific teacher, total number of tardies by race, gender, etc.). The system works as follows:
